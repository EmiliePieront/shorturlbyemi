# URL SHORTENER 

## My first url shortener 

I follow some courses on Udemy, and here is the course about PHP and MySQL by Louis Nicolas Leuillet
In this course we made an url shortener.

## Technology 

For this project we only use html and PHP + MySQL.
My database is a free base on [Remote MySQL](https://remotemysql.com/).

## Where can i test it? 

You can try my app on [this link](https://shorturlbyemi.herokuapp.com/)
Just a detail : each url must be unique. So you can't add twice the same link.
